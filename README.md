# TopHat

TopHat aims to be an elegant system resource monitor for the GNOME shell. It
displays CPU, memory, disk, and network activity in the GNOME top bar.

## Release notes

See [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for the list of fixes and new functionality
included in each release.

## Installation

Install TopHat from the [GNOME Shell extensions
page](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5219/tophat/).

### Requirements

- GNOME 45 or newer (older releases of TopHat are available for GNOME 3.32 -
  44 in the legacy branch at https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/tree/legacy)
- A modestly recent release of the Linux kernel (anything >= 5.0 should work)
- NetworkManager (to monitor network devices)

### Compatibility

The latest release of TopHat has been tested on the following systems:

- Arch Linux
- Debian Trixie
- Fedora 42
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 25.04

Even if your system is not in this list, as long as it meets the
requirements mentioned above, you should be able to run TopHat. If not, please
file a bug report on [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/issues).

### Manual installation

If you prefer not to use https://extensions.gnome.org to install and update
GNOME Shell extensions, you can manually install TopHat by following these
steps. You may need to install the `unzip` and `gnome-extensions-app`
utilities first.

1. Download the latest TopHat release from
   https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/releases.
2. Ensure your local extension directory exists by running the command `mkdir
-p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io`.
3. Extract the TopHat ZIP file into your local extension directory with the
   command `unzip [path-to-tophat.zip] -d
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io`
4. Log out of your computer and log back in (or restart your system).
5. Enable TopHat with the command `gnome-extensions enable tophat@fflewddur.github.io`.

## Settings

All of TopHat's settings are displayed in its preferences window, and this is the recommended approach for modifying them. If, however, you need to work with these from the command like, you can use the `gsettings` tools to read and modify them. To view all available settings and their current values, use the command:

```
gsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io/schemas list-recursively org.gnome.shell.extensions.tophat
```

Settings can be adjusted with the command:

```
gsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io/schemas set org.gnome.shell.extensions.tophat [key] [value]
```

## Contributing

Contributions to improve TopHat are welcome! To avoid duplicate work, check
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/issues) first. If an
issue doesn't already exist for your idea, please create one.

TopHat uses Yarn to manage dependencies and define development tasks. Learn
how to install Yarn at https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install.

`yarn`: Install project dependencies.  
`yarn build`: Build the project.  
`yarn lint`: Check for common problems.  
`yarn lint:fix`: Fix common problems found by ESLint.  
`yarn format`: Run Prettier to keep the project's coding style consistent.

To keep the code format consistent, please use run `yarn lint && yarn format`
before submitting a PR. If you use VS Code, consider installing the
ESLint and Prettier extensions to automatically run these tools for you.

### Useful development commands

To view logs for GNOME Shell:

    journalctl -f /usr/bin/gnome-shell

To view logs for extension preferences:

    journalctl -f /usr/bin/gjs

To simulate heavy system load, use the `stress-ng` tool, e.g.:

    stress-ng --timeout 10s --cpu 8
    stress-ng --vm-bytes 80% --vm-populate -t 30 -vm 4

To test the development version:

    cd [path to tophat repo]
    yarn build
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
    ln -s [path to tophat repo]/dist ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io
